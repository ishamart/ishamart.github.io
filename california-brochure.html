        </p> <h1>History</h1> <p id="history"> California wasn't always the bustling state it is now.
        It started of, like most USA states, as a land inhabited with Native Americans.
        When people came to America, as you might know, they first colonized 13 states on the opposite sides of the USA.
        Only a few people ventured beyond and those who did were usualy high class explorers or scientists.
        However, one day, a man named James W.
        Marshall found gold in California! Many people rushed over, all hoping for a share of this prize! This was called the Gold Rush.
        Gold was found, but not everone got it.
        However, at this point, many people had come to Calfornia.
        After the Gold Rush, several of them started their own buisnesses.
        Many, many shops began to open, and California was begining to become bigger.
        People began to swarm in from other places as well, to California and the other states.
        With lots more events, California became what it is today.
