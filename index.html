        <h1>The Aliens of our universe</h1>
        <img src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/avatars/purple-pi-pink.png" alt="Pinkasaur Alien">
        <p>The <em> Aliens </em> are the  <strong>coolest </strong>creatures. There are many reasons for this.<em> Many, Many</em> reasons.
          There are thousands of species of aliens all in different shapes in sizes!  </p> <p> This will tell you about a couple of different aliens.
        The alien in the picture above is a Pinkasaurus Alien from Planet Xarnitnia III, Galaxy Chandlier.
        It is very rare, and is found more than 700,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 light years away from earth.
        It has very picky needs and thousands thrive in Xarnitnia III thanks to it's freezing temperatures a grvitational pull stronger than jupiter's.
        The Pinkasaurus feeds mostly on the rocks of Xarnitnia III's core.
        They are able to escape small amounts of gravity to get around, but when ever they need to, they let go of that power so they can get their food.
        It is the main interest of scientists, how this anti-gravity power is obtained</p> <p> The next alien is the Dancing Primary on Planet Ballet, Galaxy Theatre II.
        
        These aliens may look harmless with their tiny bodies and petite clothes, but do not be fooled.
        If their was a list of top 3 most dangerous aliens, Dancing Primarys would be on it.
        Their dances are so soft and graceful that you don't see anything but the dance, rather like how a sirens song traps you in it.
        When this process is done, the leader of the troop will catch you and you will be alien dinner.
        This power is quite attention grabbing, but something no one has dared investigate on further</p> <p>
        This next alien is the Gobo from Planet Giga, Galaxy Scratch.
        Their is only one troop remaining, but they have survived on this planet for millions of years and young are being born every week.
        However, these creatures had a tough time.
        Planet Giga was harsh.
        There is too much air for the Gobo's.
        It is too hot for even a fire proof satelite there.
        This last tribe of Gobo's have had to adapt to these unwelcoming conditions.
        Scientist hope too become friends with these creatures and learn from them.
        </p> <p> The last aliens today are the Beasties from Planet Boasty, Galaxy Bastie.
        These creatures are huge with vicious fangs and sharp claws, not to mention their deadly smells.
        You would be surprised to know they are the most gentle aliens scientists have found! They use their sharp attributes to claw and chew the tough under ground plants.
        They have many predatorial aliens though, it's the only time they have been known to use their toughness on another creature.
        Scientists belive these attributes could be great for digging.
